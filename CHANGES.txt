ZZZKBot - Changes
=================

Updated:    1st September 2017


Version 1.5.0
-------------
Version submitted on 1st September 2017 for the 2017 AIIDE Starcraft AI
competition. Some major changes are that it now uses BWAPI 4.2.0 (not
4.1.2), requires the "Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio
2017" (x86 variant) to run (not 2013), requires Visual Studio 2017 to build
(not 2013), now uses the "bwapi-data/read" and "bwapi-data/write" folders
for learning purposes, and no longer runs on Windows XP SP3 (because BWAPI
version 4.2.0 doesn't).

Version 1.4.0
-------------
Version submitted on 16th July 2017 for the CIG 2017 Starcraft AI
competition. It has logic to read and write files but only uses them for
logging/record-keeping purposes - it does not use them for any learning
logic.

Version 1.3
-----------
Version submitted on 19th December 2016 for the SSCAIT 2016 Starcraft AI
competition.

Version 1.2
-----------
Version submitted on 7th September 2016 for the AIIDE 2016 Starcraft AI
competition. See file "SCAI2016_ENTRY.txt" for submission details. The
instructions to build and install are the same as AIIDE 2015 except that I
inserted this step in INSTALL.txt that I forgot to write in AIIDE 2015:

3. If the machine where ZZZKBot will be run does not have Microsoft Visual
Studio 2013 installed, you will need to install the 32-bit variant of the
"Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2013" if not already
installed (vcredist_x86.exe (i.e. 32-bit) is only one you need for Windows
XP). Currently it can be downloaded from Microsoft's website at:

Version 1.1
-----------
Version submitted on 24th December 2015 for the SSCAIT 2015 Starcraft AI
competition.

Version 1.0
-----------
Version submitted on 10th October 2015 for the AIIDE 2015 Starcraft AI
competition. See file "SCAI2015_ENTRY.txt" for submission details. ZZZKBot
is an improved and heavily refactored version of ZZZBot (ZZZBot won first
rank in the CIG 2015 Starcraft AI competition).
