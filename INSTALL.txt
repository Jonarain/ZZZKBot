ZZZKBot - Install
=================

Updated:    16th July 2017


The following steps are required to build ZZZKBot from source code:

These instructions are simply the same as how you would compile BWAPI
4.1.2's ExampleAIModule project from source. Note that later versions of
Windows should probably work too but I have not tested them.

1. On Windows (preferably Windows 7 SP1), install Microsoft Visual Studio
2013 (preferably Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows Desktop;
note that this is registerware, i.e. it can be downloaded for free from
Microsoft without registering, but after 30 days it will prompt you and
require you to register (free of charge) to be able to continue using it).

2. Install BWAPI 4.1.2 to a path that does not contain spaces. I am not
sure whether the following instructions will work if you install it to a
path that contains spaces - I haven't tried it.

3. Set the environment variable BWAPI_DIR to the path of where you installed
BWAPI 4.1.2 to. Note: the project does not depend on any other libraries,
does not reference any absolute file paths, and when the bot is run it does
not require any hard-coded file paths (e.g. it doesn't matter what directory
you have installed Starcraft: Broodwar to).

4. In Windows Explorer, double-click the ZZZKBot.vcxproj file.

5. Change the drop-down from "Debug" to "Release".

6. From the menu, select: BUILD -> Build Solution. It should build with no
errors/warnings but may take quite a long time to build (say 15 minutes).

7. A folder ZZZKBot/Release/ should be automatically created when building.
The output is a single DLL file in that folder named ZZZKBot.dll.

The following steps are required to install ZZZKBot:

Note: ZZZKBot is intended to support being run on Windows XP SP3 and later
versions of Windows up to and including at least Windows 7 SP1 (later
versions of Windows such as 8.1, 10 are hoped to work but have not been
tested, and Vista has not been tested either). It has successfully been
compiled on Windows 7 SP1 and the resulting DLL worked fine when run on both
Windows XP SP3 or Windows 7 SP1.

1. Install BWAPI 4.1.2 if you haven't already (and its dependencies, e.g.
Broodwar).

2. The only file required is the DLL named ZZZKBot.dll from the
ZZZKBot/Release/ folder (ZZZKBot is not comprised of any other/optional
files when running it). Do not rename the DLL or the player name (should
be "ZZZKBot"). Do not change the case-sensitivity of these letters.

3. If the machine where ZZZKBot will be run does not have Microsoft Visual
Studio 2013 installed, you will need to install the 32-bit variant of the
"Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2013" if not already
installed (vcredist_x86.exe (i.e. 32-bit) is only one you need for Windows
XP). Currently it can be downloaded from Microsoft's website at:
https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=40784

4. Install and run the DLL with BWAPI version 4.1.2 as you would normally do
for any other BWAPI AIModule bot, e.g. copy the DLL to the following folder
(create parent folders if necessary):
<Starcraft folder>/bwapi-data/AI/
and configure its path via the "ai" setting in:
<Starcraft folder>/bwapi-data/bwapi.ini
then run e.g. ChaosLauncher and inject as usual, etc. Notes: currently,
ZZZKBot only properly supports playing as the Zerg race. ZZZKBot does not
require any other DLLs apart from BWAPI 4.1.2 (it does not use BWTA2/BWTA
at all). ZZZKBot uses disk I/O (i.e. has logic to read and write files) but
currently only uses them for logging/record-keeping purposes - it does not
currently use them for any learning logic. It tailors its behaviour to
particular opponents based on in-game names of the opponent bot(s).
