ZZZKBot - ReadMe
================

Updated:    1st September 2017


ZZZKBot is a bot for Starcraft: Broodwar. It is designed to compete against
other bots. It is not designed to compete against humans - everyone except
possibly very weak players should have very little trouble beating it. It
uses BWAPI as an API for interacting with Starcraft: Broodwar. See
AIIDE2017_ENTRY.txt for more information about the (1.5.0) version that was
submitted for the 2017 AIIDE Starcraft AI competition.

Some things to know about ZZZKBot:
----------------------------------

1. It's open-source, and 100% free - it uses the widely used
   "GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 3" license.

2. It depends on other libraries, but they and their dependencies (and their
   dependencies, ad infinitum) are also open source and 100% free.

3. The other libraries it depends on are as follows (their dependencies are
   not listed):

    - BWAPI  (see https://github.com/bwapi/bwapi/)

      BWAPI is an API for interacting with Starcraft: Broodwar. Starcraft
      and Starcraft: Broodwar are trademarks of Blizzard Entertainment.
      BWAPI is a third party "hack" that violates the End User License
      Agreement (EULA). It is strongly recommended to purchase a legitimate
      copy of Starcraft: Broodwar from Blizzard Entertainment before using
      BWAPI. BWAPI uses the "GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)
      version 3" license.
