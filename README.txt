   "GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 3" license.

2. It depends on other libraries, but they and their dependencies
   (and their dependencies, ad infinitum) are also open source and 100%
   free.

3. The other libraries it depends on are as follows (their dependencies are
   not listed):

    - BWAPI  (see https://github.com/bwapi/bwapi/)

      BWAPI is an API for interacting with Starcraft: Broodwar. Starcraft
      and Starcraft: Broodwar are trademarks of Blizzard Entertainment.
      BWAPI is a third party "hack" that violates the End User License
      Agreement (EULA). It is strongly recommended to purchase a legitimate
      copy of Starcraft: Broodwar from Blizzard Entertainment before using
      BWAPI. BWAPI uses the "GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)
      version 3" license.
